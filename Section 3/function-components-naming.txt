Function Components Naming
In the next lecture, we'll learn how to manage state in functional components (instead of class-based components).

In case you're getting an error with the code shown in the next lecture, simply assign a capitalized variable name to the variable that holds your functional component.

Example:

Use

    const App = () => { ... }
instead of

    const app = () => { ... }
Technically, that's not required but depending on your project setup, the built-in linter (a code quality checking tool) that comes with create-react-app might not like the lowercase variable name.

You can also avoid this by creating projects with the right react-scripts version, which I would recommend for this course anyways (see the setup video, lecture 26)

    create-react-app my-app --scripts-version 1.1.5
